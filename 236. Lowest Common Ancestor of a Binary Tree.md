Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the : “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**).”

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarytree.png)

```
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarytree.png)

```
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: root = [1,2], p = 1, q = 2
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 10<sup>5</sup>]`.
*   `-10<sup>9</sup> <= Node.val <= 10<sup>9</sup>`
*   All `Node.val` are **unique**.
*   `p != q`
*   `p` and `q` will exist in the tree.


#### Solution

Language: **C++**

* For a given root, recursively call LCA(root.left, p, q) and LCA(root.right, p, q).  
* If both returns a valid node which means p, q are in different subtrees, then root will be their LCA.  
* If only one valid node returns, which means p, q are in the same subtree, return that valid node as their LCA.
* Time: O(n)
* Space: O(h)
