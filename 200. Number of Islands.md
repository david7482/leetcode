Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid `grid` which represents a map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return _the number of islands_.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3
```

**Constraints:**

*   `m == grid.length`
*   `n == grid[i].length`
*   `1 <= m, n <= 300`
*   `grid[i][j]` is `'0'` or `'1'`.


#### Solution

Language: **C++**

* use DFS approach
* Time: O(M*N)
* Space: O(M*N)

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int numIslands(vector<vector<char>>& grid) {
        int m = grid.size();
        int n = grid[0].size();
        
        int ret = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == '1') {
                    ret++;
                    helper(grid, i, j);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
    
    void helper(vector<vector<char>>& grid, int i, int j) {
        int m = grid.size();
        int n = grid[0].size();
        
        if (i < 0 || j < 0 || i >= m || j >= n || grid[i][j] == '0') return;
        
        grid[i][j] = '0';
        
        helper(grid, i-1, j);
        helper(grid, i+1, j);
        helper(grid, i, j-1);
        helper(grid, i, j+1);
    }
};
```

* use BFS approach

* Space: O(max(M, N))
