Given a string `s`, find the length of the **longest substring** without repeating characters.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: s = ""
Output: 0
```

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10<sup>4</sup>`
*   `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.


#### Solution

Language: **C++**

* Use `set` to record substring and take sliding-window approach
* Time: O(2*N) -> O(N)
* Space: O(N)

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string str) {
        unordered_set<char> s;
        
        int ret = 0;
        int l = 0, r = 0;
        while (l < str.size() && r < str.size()) {
            if (s.count(str[r]) == 0) {
                s.insert(str[r]);
                ret = max(ret, r - l + 1);
                r++;
            } else {
                s.erase(str[l]);
                l++;
            }
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
