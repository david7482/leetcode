Winter is coming! During the contest, your first job is to design a standard heater with a fixed warm radius to warm all the houses.

Every house can be warmed, as long as the house is within the heater's warm radius range.

Given the positions of `houses` and `heaters` on a horizontal line, return _the minimum radius standard of heaters so that those heaters could cover all houses._

**Notice** that all the `heaters` follow your radius standard, and the warm radius will the same.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: houses = [1,2,3], heaters = [2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The only heater was placed in the position 2, and if we use the radius 1 standard, then all the houses can be warmed.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: houses = [1,2,3,4], heaters = [1,4]
Output: 1
Explanation: The two heater was placed in the position 1 and 4\. We need to use radius 1 standard, then all the houses can be warmed.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: houses = [1,5], heaters = [2]
Output: 3
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= houses.length, heaters.length <= 3 * 10<sup>4</sup>`
*   `1 <= houses[i], heaters[i] <= 10<sup>9</sup>`


#### Solution

Language: **C++**

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int findRadius(vector<int>& houses, vector<int>& heaters) {
        sort(heaters.begin(), heaters.end());
        
        int ret = 0, n = heaters.size();
        for (int h : houses) {
            int l = 0, r = n - 1;
            while (l <= r) {
                int m = (l + r) / 2;
                if (heaters[m] < h) l = m + 1;
                else r = m - 1;
            }
            
            int d1 = l == n ? INT_MAX : abs(heaters[l] - h);
            int d2 = l == 0 ? INT_MAX : abs(heaters[l-1] - h);
            
            ret = max(ret, min(d1, d2));
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
