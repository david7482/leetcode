Given an `m x n` matrix `board` containing `'X'` and `'O'`, _capture all regions that are 4-directionallyÂ surrounded by_ `'X'`.

A region is **captured** by flipping all `'O'`s into `'X'`s in that surrounded region.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/xogrid.jpg)

```
Input: board = [["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
Output: [["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
Explanation: Surrounded regions should not be on the border, which means that any 'O' on the border of the board are not flipped to 'X'. Any 'O' that is not on the border and it is not connected to an 'O' on the border will be flipped to 'X'. Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells connected horizontally or vertically.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: board = [["X"]]
Output: [["X"]]
```

**Constraints:**

*   `m == board.length`
*   `n == board[i].length`
*   `1 <= m, n <= 200`
*   `board[i][j]` is `'X'` or `'O'`.


#### Solution

Language: **C++**

* Start traverse from the boarders and collect connected 'O' cells which is the `unsurrounded` cells.
* After the collecting, mark all 'O' cells which are not in the `unsurrounded` collection.
* BFS approach
* Time: O(MxN)
* Space: O(MxN)
