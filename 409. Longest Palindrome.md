Given a string `s` which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, return _the length of the **longest palindrome**_ that can be built with those letters.

Letters are **case sensitive**, for example, `"Aa"` is not considered a palindrome here.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abccccdd"
Output: 7
Explanation:
One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "a"
Output: 1
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "bb"
Output: 2
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 2000`
*   `s` consists of lowercase **and/or** uppercase English letters only.


#### Solution

Language: **C++**

* Build the frequency of each character (be careful of the lower/upper cases)
* We could only take 1 odd character to build the palindrome.
* Time: O(N)
* Space: O(1)

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int longestPalindrome(string s) {
        vector<int> counts(52, 0);
        for (char c : s) {
            if (c >= 'a') counts[c - 'a' + 26]++;
            else counts[c - 'A']++;
        }
        
        int sum = 0;
        bool hasOdd = false;
        for (int c : counts) {
            if (c & 0x01) {
                hasOdd = true;
                sum += (c - 1);
            } else {
                sum += c;
            }
        }
        
        return hasOdd ? sum + 1 : sum;
    }
};
```
