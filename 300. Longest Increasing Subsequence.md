Given an integer array `nums`, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.

A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, `[3,6,2,7]` is a subsequence of the array `[0,3,1,6,2,2,7]`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]
Output: 4
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 2500`
*   `-10<sup>4</sup> <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>4</sup>`

**Follow up:** Can you come up with an algorithm that runs in `O(n log(n))` time complexity?


#### Solution

Language: **C++**

* DP solution: dp[i] means the longest increasing subsequence length that ends with i-th element.
* dp[i] = max(dp[j] + 1) if j < i and nums[j] < nums[i]  
  dp[...] = 1
* Time: O(N^2)
* Space: O(N)

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLIS(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<int> dp(nums.size(), 1);
        
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if (nums[i] > nums[j]) {
                    dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1);
                }
            }
        }
                
        int ret = 0;
        for (int n : dp)
            ret = max(ret, n);
        
        return ret;
    }
};
